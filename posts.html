<p>A huge collab reimagining the Bionicle sets of 2007! Pridak went through quite a lot of revisions as I wasn't quite able to settle on a design in my head. It all started with a head design incorporating the Pridak blades and some red teeth to mimic the original set's edgy red "colouring". I quickly scrapped it because of the lack of shark-like qualities and overall size.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/466439155325337600/1060093796806819850/20230103_231124.jpg?width=671&amp;height=500" title="Pridak WIP 1" /></p>
<p>I made some attempts to upscale the original Pridak head mould but this turned out really goofy looking and I scrapped that quickly too.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/466439155325337600/1060370780636057701/20230104_173405.jpg?width=326&amp;height=671" title="Pridak WIP 2" /></p>
<p>The head I settled on fit the bill perfectly, at least for me personally. It resembled a shark, had some mechanical details and on the whole looked quite clean and menacing. </p>

<p>From there, I haphazardly constructed a really fragile body and struggled my way through some legs that I ended up quite happy with. A lot of the techniques and simple connections I normally rely on were not holding up at all with the large weight and long limbs. </p>

<p>I actually considered the build done at this point. However, after staring at the finished photo for a few days I wasn't really satisfied with how flimsy it was and the way that it was posed so statically. Also, everybody else in the collab was starting to show some of the killer stuff they had in the works and I felt pretty driven to match that as well. I decided to rework the whole body and work on strengthening the joints to make the whole build more animalistic and dynamic. I settled on a pose right from the start and worked on building up the proportions in a way that fit the pose I had in mind.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/188495704@N06">Ari</a> did amazing work on all the edits in the collab. His work makes all the builds pop and realy unifies all the diverse builds under a single theme. It also plays so well into the nostalgia of the original set boxart and graphics. Huge kudos to him for putting in that much work for so many pictures! Please check out all the other builds in the gallery, there's some great standouts and some really unique takes on the original sets.</p>
<p>Here's the Flickr gallery with all the rest of the amazing builds!</p>

<p>All my builds in 2022. Was not nearly as productive in 2022 as 2021, which was a year where I managed to average 2 builds a month(!!) 
My personal favourites were <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/51862622666/in/photostream">Ashi</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/52088459557/in/photostream/">Sein</a>. I'm not too happy with my Bio-Cup builds - they were quite rushed and I found it hard to pin down strong ideas in brick-built form. I relied pretty heavily on existing part lists from recently bought sets to focus my brain on a consistent build. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/52118724547/in/dateposted/">妈妈</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/52171852302/in/photostream/">Lacerta Navis</a> are the worst offenders and are scarily close to being glorified alt builds.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I have a couple existing WIPs and ideas that I want to get done for 2023. There's also some collab builds that I have in progress. It's a lot of fun dropping a bunch of builds around a theme and I'm looking forward to seeing the response to the ones that I'm a part of. </p> </div><div class="post" id="Secret_Santa_2022"> <h2>Secret Santa 2022 - Mia</h2>

<p>Based off his <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johanndakitsch/36748373794/in/dateposted/">MEA-32</a> build with some minor inspiration from his really cute <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johanndakitsch/albums/72157631528458537">Weirdtopia</a> builds.</p>
