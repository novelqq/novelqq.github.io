<p>All my builds in 2022. Was not nearly as productive in 2022 as 2021, which was a year where I managed to average 2 builds a month(!!) 
My personal favourites were <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/51862622666/in/photostream">Ashi</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/52088459557/in/photostream/">Sein</a>. I'm not too happy with my Bio-Cup builds - they were quite rushed and I found it hard to pin down strong ideas in brick-built form. I relied pretty heavily on existing part lists from recently bought sets to focus my brain on a consistent build. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/52118724547/in/dateposted/">妈妈</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/52171852302/in/photostream/">Lacerta Navis</a> are the worst offenders and are scarily close to being glorified alt builds.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I have a couple existing WIPs and ideas that I want to get done for 2023. There's also some collab builds that I have in progress. It's a lot of fun dropping a bunch of builds around a theme and I'm looking forward to seeing the response to the ones that I'm a part of. </p> </div><div class="post" id="Secret_Santa_2022"> <h2>Secret Santa 2022 - Mia</h2>

<p>A Secret Santa build for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johanndakitsch/">Johann Dakitsch</a></p>
<p>Based off his <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johanndakitsch/36748373794/in/dateposted/">MEA-32</a> build with some minor inspiration from his really cute <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johanndakitsch/albums/72157631528458537">Weirdtopia</a> builds.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p> </div>
