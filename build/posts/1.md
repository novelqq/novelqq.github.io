All my builds in 2022. Was not nearly as productive in 2022 as 2021, which was a year where I managed to average 2 builds a month(!!) 
My personal favourites were [Ashi](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/51862622666/in/photostream) and [Sein](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzz-e/52088459557/in/photostream/). I'm not too happy with my Bio-Cup builds - they were quite rushed and I found it hard to pin down strong ideas in brick-built form. I relied pretty heavily on existing part lists from recently bought sets to focus my brain on a consistent build. 妈妈 and Lacerta Navis are the worst offenders and are scarily close to being glorified alt builds.

Looking forward, I have a couple existing WIPs and ideas that I want to get done for 2023. There's also some collab builds that I have in progress. It's a lot of fun dropping a bunch of builds around a theme and I'm looking forward to seeing the response to the ones that I'm a part of.
