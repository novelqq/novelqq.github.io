My last MOC of the year probably, since I'm moving in the beginning of January. This is my attempt at making a large posable mecha. Every major joint uses stacked balljoints to keep it stiff and stable in a bunch of different poses. I went a little overboard with the chunky armour on top though, so the range of mobility is a bit limited. Despite this, I think the overall look is relatively unique and worth the limitations. I might try and make something more flexible in the future. I really like a lot of the new technic panels and parts. There's a neat system and modularity to it that makes it easy to construct nice looking shapes over top of a frame. It'll be nice to get more of the new parts in more colours in the future.
