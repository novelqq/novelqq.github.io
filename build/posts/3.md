## Bio-Cup 2023 Recap

The annual Bio-Cup contest is a great way to challenge yourself to build exciting characters in a series of round-based head-to-head battles. This year, I went 4 rounds in before tapping out against my competition. 

## Preliminary Round - [Meng Yan](https://flic.kr/p/2oFoeYB)

A spectral being that preys on people's dreams of an afterlife. Has lived for over a thousand years. 
The theme was "Villain", so I opted to draw inspiration from some enemy designs from the game Bayonetta 2 and the general mythology of the kitsune. Dark, edgy colours accentuate its mysterious and malicious allure.


## Round 1 - [Fan Tian's Pilgrims](https://flic.kr/p/2oJwjTz)

Followers of a deity. The theme for this was "Mountains". Conceptualized as a giant mountain-sized golem that resembles traditional Buddha statues, and a smaller nomad figure to reinforce scale. A shrine with a vine-like bonsai grows out of the golem's chest. 

## Round 2 - [War Devil](https://flic.kr/p/2oMCduu "War Devil")

For the theme "Violence", I looked to Tatsuki Fujumoto's Chainsaw Man for inspiration. A nuclear bomb with teeth for the head, and a gory, skinless arm to represent the cost of war. The chest is meant to resemble the barrel of a revolver. The small arms encircling the collar were meant to hold an assortment of guns and rifles, but I ran out of time. 

## Round 3 - [Sludge Runner](https://flic.kr/p/2oQjb33 "Sludge Runner")

Loosely inspired after maschinen krieger kits. The theme was "Diesel-punk". A large mecha suit that hauls oil and refuels other machines using a gas pump. Effort was focused on creating large smooth countours using mostly parabolic, non-square shapes, a rarity in the Lego part catalogue.
