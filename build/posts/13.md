Inspired by Ghost in the Shell and 3D designs by [Andrei Kurylovich](https://x.com/aurora_machina). The propellors spin via a gear on the back, and the pegs on the legs allow it to pick up a cargo container that I forgot to take a picture of. I'd like to show both those functions off but I don't have a motor, stand, or time to do that right now. Already rushed these pictures so that I could share it before I leave tomorrow to travel for a whole month! Maybe I'll post a travel blog for that as well...
