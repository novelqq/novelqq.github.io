Quick little build to make sure I got something out in January, lol. 2025 has been a little rough so far, had a really rough few weeks with various colds and sickness on top of a tiring move to a new town. I think everything is mostly settled now so I should be able to get into a rhythm doing all the things I said I would do this year. I wanted to do a little 2024 recap of stuff I read/watched/listened to in 2024 but the last month basically wiped my memory of it all so I'll save it for 2025. There will be time to scream into a void 11 months from now.
