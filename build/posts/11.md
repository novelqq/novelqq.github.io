The head and shoulders were from a very quick build that I made for a Knight Fantasy Collab at a convention. It had some really goofy prefab limbs on it and a Knights Kindgom axe. It sat in a box for a long time before my nephew came across it when we were rummaging through some boxes. He thought it was really cool until he realized how flimsy it was, haha. I thought the shape was reasonably interesting still so I built a more substantial body and added the wires to make it look like his arms are being ripped apart.
