Started as a build to use the palm fronds I got from Lugbulk. As you can see they never actually made it to the end, lol. I briefly tried making some more elaborate angel wings with them but wasn't really satisfied with the result. The wings are mostly just some visual flair, I guess the real highlight here is the technic beams and open studs being used as a texture. I think I could've done some more interesting things with the idea but I'm having fun making stuff without too much overhauling and deliberation. I do have some more complicated/elaborate ideas that I'll get to soon though!
