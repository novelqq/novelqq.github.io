Experimenting with some technic beam frame techniques to achieve some good angles for system slopes. I'm finding myself using less and less Bionicle parts, only a handful snuck their way in here. Still finding joint mobility the hardest thing to get down properly when working with majority system builds. I find the ratchet systems too limiting to rely on in many scenarios.
