        <p> The internet has always been pretty shit. When I started using it extensively as a small 10 year old child
            circa
            2008, I was frequently blasted with gruesome banner ads, porn, viruses, pop-ups, email phishing, soulless
            commercials and products, and a wide array of graphic images and content not suitable for anyone in
            particular,
            but
            definitely not me, whose access was unrestricted and curiosity unsatiable. My internet speed was dogshit, it
            taking
            an agonizing amount of time to load webpages with any sort of heavy video or audio content, and I would
            often
            pirate
            games overnight and wake up to find them not even a third of the way complete. Finding things felt like an
            absurd
            pagan ritual where you would first crawl Google's PageRank using carefully chosen keywords, browse the
            bowels of
            random forums and webrings, and ultimately get lost in curated walled gardens that were becoming
            increasingly
            insular in their culture.
            The reason for me spending so much time online is probably similar to why many other children, teens, ended
            up
            glued
            to it regardless; yes, it was a game that I enjoyed getting better at, learning about computers and how to
            navigate
            around the minefield, but it was also easier than real life, and the small, tantalizing nuggets of gold you
            would
            find amongst the shitpile kept you looking for more. If you didn't fit in somewhere in school or a club, if
            you
            were
            an alien, an other, there were countless anonymous internet in-groups that you could attach yourself to by
            simply
            spending more time there, by lurking. <br>
            My internet journey took me to strange, edgier places, turned me into a weeb, accentuated mental illness,
            and
            accumulated for me acquaintances and friends both online and offline that all talked the same
            internet-poisoned,
            ever-changing language. Having online cred became such an important group signifier for me that even when I
            became
            more popular and comfortable in my high school life (A new-found power that I only used for evil, it should
            be
            said), I still spent a large majority of time talking on voice calls, on message boards, sharing and
            creating
            memes
            and blog articles, finding obscure music and otherwise being a huge shut-in in-between my Dr. Jekyll normie
            outings
            and hobbies.
            In college, I attempted a full back half "Aku no Hana"-esque normie transition, doing normal college things
            like
            club activities, study groups, drinking, partying, seeing shows, kissing girls, jerking off a dude at Sun
            Peaks, etc. I ended up starting a
            "serious"
            relationship, and between the stress of classes, my friends-only-by-proxy, and my least likeable behaviors,
            had
            a
            certifiable crashout that left me wondering if was even capable of having relationships ever, at all. For
            over a
            year, I attended classes alone, wept uncontrollably at my shitty job in the warehouse bathroom at 4 am, I
            experienced strange, unexplainable medical emergencies that hospitalized me briefly, and my body and face
            changed so
            much that neither I or former colleagues could recognize me. I *did* recover from some of that eventually,
            finding
            some new friends, reconnecting with older ones. I tried to grow as a person, acknowledging the resentful,
            anti-social parts of me that prevented me from making real connections. But I also retreated to what was
            comfortable
            and stable for me: Cool detachment, distanced irony. Of course, lockdowns came not long after, and given it
            was
            the
            only option, I gleefully sublimated myself to the online world, a place that I still thought was familiar, a
            place
            that I could navigate with ease and understand wholly. Obviously, that's not true, I understood almost
            nothing,
            and
            anything I did understand was changing or disappearing outright at every moment. <br>
            Covid only accelerated a trend that tech companies have been working towards for decades. Walled gardens,
            algorithmic feeds, AI content, ragebait, radicalization, a whole population divided and conquered,
            sequestered
            and
            alone. The forces are overwhelming, unstoppable. All the obscurities and internet lore that I internalized
            as my
            own
            have been signal blasted to everyone with a phone. They decide elections. Marginalize groups. Dominate the
            news.
            4chan felt like a secret, but now I see it everywhere. 100 years of /v/ Gamergate. /fit/ broscience
            podcasts.
            /mu/
            top 100 tiktoks in /fa/ moodboards. /r9k/ crashouts. /pol/ shooters. This world is already fated to end, and
            our
            islands are becoming smaller and smaller. I've always been fascinated by Japanese media centered on the
            internet
            in
            the 90s, 00s, denpa stuff, Boogiepop, Welcome to the NHK, Serial Experiments Lain, Lily Chou Chou, Peep Show
            and
            so
            on, and I think now I understand why, it's because their highly connected internet, economic recession, and
            the
            Subway Sarin Attack caused them to immediately understand where this was going. They have already
            experienced
            political stagnancy, collective isolation and emotional unavailability, dissociated online identities,
            violent
            cults
            and doggish devotion to capital, it just took a while for the rest of the world to follow suit. <br>
            So, my relationship to the internet is complicated. It's undeniably formulated so much of who I am and what
            I
            like.
            I've found deep friendships and social groups where I feel like I belong, and people understand me. It's
            allowed
            me
            to stay connected with friends who moved away. It's been a safe haven when real life was too miserable and
            lonely,
            when I felt trapped or my real life relationships with my family were too painful to deal with. But
            ultimately
            the
            internet does not need me, yet I am parasitically linked to it. I have constructed a whole lived memory of
            being
            online, and I am scared now because the internet and reality seem to have devoured the other. The
            overarching
            parts
            of the internet that I thought were static, unchanging bastions no longer exist, or never mattered. People
            are
            impermeable, disappearing with no fanfare, without a trace. The world has been engulfed, everyone is online,
            at
            a
            time when it is the most ugly and predatory. Let's all love Lain. I have one remaining pocket that continues
            to
            bring me happiness, but now I frantically spend a majority of my time thinking about how I can make that
            pocket
            exist for me in real life for more than just a couple times a year. I have been living a simulacrum of
            human,
            emotional sustenance. _Fleurs du mal._ Artificial paradises and illusory comforts. How do I make a life in
            the
            Real,
            when I have let my senses wither and deteriorate my whole life? I can't simply log off, and pretend that
            none of
            this is a part of me. I tried that once, I could not be understood. I did not understand. But I can't just
            stay
            here. I want to learn to be honest. I want to be genuine. I want to learn how to be seen. I want to see
            others.
            Selfishly, I want to bring the love I know with me, to the Real. Would they recognize me? Would I recognize
            them?
            Would I find out it was it all just facsimile, preserved in code, crumbling as it meets the oxygen in the
            atmosphere? Please, tell me how to resolve these contradictory parts of my being. I have learned to love
            where
            there
            is no flesh to reciprocate it. I have let my flesh turn cold, where bodies lay dead around me. _The
            beginning
            comes,
            whether you like it or not, but the end does not come by itself. It is you who must find it._ Once again, I
            retreat.
            How much longer? I'm still searching for the Real, but what does that even mean? I think I've made it up.
